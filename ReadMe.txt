Deaf and mute individuals may find it challenging to communicate or 
understand sentences that rely heavily on auditory or spoken language cues.
Here are some examples of sentences that may be difficult for them to act upon:

"Can you hear me?"
"Listen carefully."
"He's speaking loudly."
"She has a beautiful voice."
"I'm calling your name."
"Turn up the volume."
"It's too noisy here."
"Let's have a conversation."
"Do you understand what I'm saying?"
"What's that sound?"

the array is as following
['yes' , 'B', 'can' , 'careful','help', 'listen', 'more' , 'no', 'thank you','yes']
